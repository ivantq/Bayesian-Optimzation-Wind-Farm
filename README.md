# Thesis Bayesian Optimzation Wind Farms
This is the code belonging to the Bachelor Thesis: . [test](Thesis-Bayesian-Optimzation-Wind-Farms/A data-driven approach for wind farm power maximisation.pdf)
      

## Research
The objective of this research is to show that the power output of a scaled wind farm can be optimised, using a model
free optimisation algorithm. Traditionally, wind turbines are controlled to optimise their individual power production.
The result of this is that the first turbine has a high power output while the downstream turbines experience turbulent
wind, resulting in lower power as well as higher damage. A way to optimise the power production of the entire wind
farm is by misaligning some of the turbines in the yaw direction, thereby steering the turbulent wake away from
downstream turbines. In this study, Gaussian processes combined with Bayesian Optimisation have been used to approach the maximum power production of a scaled wind farm in as few measurements as possible.
