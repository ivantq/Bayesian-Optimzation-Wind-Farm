Experiments are conducted in a large boundary layer wind tunnel, using three servo-actuated and sensorized wind turbine scaled models. First, we characterize the impact on steady-state power output of wake deflection, achieved by yawing the upstream wind turbines. Next, we illustrate the capability of the proposed wind farm controller to dynamically driving the upstream wind turbines to the optimal yaw misalignment setting. 1.},

abstract = {Wind turbines are typically operated to maximize their own performance without considering the impact of wake effects on nearby turbines. There is the potential to increase total power and reduce structural loads by properly coordinating the individual turbines in a wind farm. The effective design and analysis of such coordinated controllers requires turbine wake models of sufficient accuracy but low computational complexity. This paper first formulates a coordinated control problem for a two-turbine array. Next, the paper reviews several existing simulation tools that range from low-fidelity, quasi-static models to high-fidelity, computational fluid dynamic models. These tools are compared by evaluating the power, loads, and flow characteristics for the coordinated two-turbine array. The results in this paper highlight the advantages and disadvantages of existing wake models for design and analysis of coordinated wind farm controllers.},

abstract = {Wind plant control is an active field of research in which controllers are developed that seek to maximize overall wind-plant performance in terms of power production, turbine structural loads, or both. Such control strategies are often different from those that are optimal for an individual turbine. One type of wind-plant control method is to redirect the wakes of upstream turbines so that they avoid downstream turbines. In this paper, we investigate several possible methods for redirecting turbine wakes, including some existing and some novel approaches. The methods are compared in terms of their ability to redirect turbine wakes and their effects on turbine power capture and structural loads using the high-fidelity wind plant simulation tool Simulator for On/Offshore Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA). {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The detailed near wake structure can only be captured with the complex ALM and ADM-R. The characteristics of the far wake are, however, represented with the simple ADM as well. The ADM-R results are almost identical to the ALM results. As it spends significantly less computation time, the ADM-R can be considered an adequate alternative to the ALM. The grid size is crucial only for the complex turbine models and the near wake characteristics. Here, at least 30 grid points per rotor diameter were required to adequately resolve the near wake flow. For the far wake and the ADM, much coarser grids were sufficient.},

abstract = {With the shortage of fossil fuel and the increasing environmental awareness, wind energy is becoming more and more important. As the market for wind energy grows, wind turbines and wind farms are becoming larger. Current utility-scale turbines extend a significant distance into the atmospheric boundary layer. Therefore, the interaction between the atmospheric boundary layer and the turbines and their wakes needs to be better understood. The turbulent wakes of upstream turbines affect the flow field of the turbines behind them, decreasing the power production and increasing mechanical loading. With a better understanding of this type of flow, wind farm developers could plan better-performing, less maintenance-intensive wind farms. Simulating this flow using computational fluid dynamics is one important way to gain a better understanding of wind farm flows. In this study, we compare the performance of actuator disc and actuator line models in producing wind turbine wakes and the wake-turbine interaction between multiple turbines. We also examine parameters that affect the performance of these models, such as grid resolution, the use of a tip-loss correction, and the way in which the turbine force is projected onto the flow field.},

In this study we show the impact of the SABL on power production and wake effects (power deficits) in offshore wind farms by means of measurements as well as large-eddy simulations (LES). Measurements show enhanced wake effects in the SABL compared to the unstable situation. Another influence on the power generation of an offshore wind farm is the distance of the wind farm to the shore. This is accounted for in the LES by a modification of surface characteristics at the coastal discontinuity. In addition to the effect of the coast, the numerical case study also shows the existence of local jets between the turbines of the wind farm.},

abstract = {The power generation of a wind farm is significantly less than the summation of the power generated by each turbine when operating as a standalone entity. This power reduction can be attributed to the energy loss due to the wake effects − the resulting velocity deficit in the wind downstream of a turbine. In the case of wind farm design, the wake losses are generally quantified using wake models. The effectiveness of wind farm design (seeking to maximize the farm output) therefore depends on the accuracy and the reliability of the wake models. This paper compares the impact of the following four analytical wake models on the wind farm power generation: (i) the Jensen model, (ii) the Larsen model, (iii) the Frandsen model, and (iv) the Ishihara model. The sensitivity of this impact to the Land Area per Turbine (LAT) and the incoming wind speed is also investigated. The wind farm power generation model used in this paper is adopted from the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO) methodology. Single wake case studies show that the velocity deficit and the wake diameter estimated by the different analytical wake models can be significantly different. A maximum difference of 70{\%} was also observed for the wind farm capacity factor values estimated using different wake models.},

The evaluation is based on six experiments where free-stream and wake wind speed profiles were measured using a ship-mounted sodar at a small offshore wind farm. The experiments were conducted at varying distances between 1.7 and 7.4 rotor diameters downstream of the wind turbine. Evaluation of the models compares the predicted and observed velocity deficits at hub height. A new method of evaluation based on determining the cumulative momentum deficit over the profiles is described. Despite the apparent simplicity of the experiments, the models give a wide range of predictions. Overall, it is not possible to establish any of the models as having individually superior performance with respect to the measurements. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {How to scale even the simplest of turbulent flows continues to be a cause for considerable controversy. In the present research, a data base compiling results from channel flow direct numerical simulations and turbulent boundary layer experiments is employed to investigate the properties of shear and normal Reynolds stresses very close to the wall. Two types of scaling based on Kolmogorov length and velocity scales are analyzed. It is shown that it is highly likely that large length scales of the order of the channel half-width or the boundary layer thickness play an important role even in the innermost regions of wallbounded turbulent flows, which hints at the persistence of Reynolds number effects in even high Reynolds number flows. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The vast majority of commercial offshore turbines have foundations on the seabed thereby restricting the depths at which offshore farms can be installed. In an attempt to facilitate access to a potential multi-Terawatt resource, a number of floating concept wind turbines have emerged. In this tutorial paper we review the control challenges associated with the design of floating turbines and summarise recent developments in the area. Of particular interest is a fore-aft oscillation induced by attempting to regulate the generator speed to its rated value. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the control problems presented are likely to change with increasing turbine size and structural flexibility.},

abstract = {Wind tunnel experiments were performed, where the development of the wake of a model wind turbine was measured using stereo Particle Image Velocimetry to observe the influence of platform pitch motion. The wakes of a classical bottom fixed turbine and a streamwise oscillating turbine are compared. Results indicate that platform pitch creates an upward shift in all components of the flow and their fluctuations. The vertical flow created by the pitch motion as well as the reduced entrainment of kinetic energy from undisturbed flows above the turbine result in potentially higher loads and less available kinetic energy for a downwind turbine. Experimental results are compared with four wake models. The wake models employed are consistent with experimental results in describing the shapes and magnitudes of the streamwise velocity component of the wake for a fixed turbine. Inconsistencies between the model predictions and experimental results arise in the floating case particularly regarding the vertical displacement of the velocity components of the flow. Furthermore, it is found that the additional degrees of freedom of a floating wind turbine add to the complexity of the wake aerodynamics and improved wake models are needed, considering vertical flows and displacements due to pitch motion.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow and its interactions with wind turbines is of great importance for optimizing the design and efficiency of wind farms. This study first focuses on recent efforts to develop and validate a large-eddy simulation (LES) framework for wind-energy applications. The subgrid-scale turbulent fluxes of momentum and heat are parameterized using tuning-free dynamic models. The turbine-induced forces are parameterized using two types of models: an actuator disk model that allows for non-uniform force distribution and includes rotational effects, and an actuator line model. The LES framework is validated against wind- tunnel measurements collected inside and above a large model wind farm. Further, this framework is used to study wind-farm effects. Comparison of simulations of flow through both aligned and staggered wind farms shows important effects of farm layout on the flow structure and wind-turbine performance. We also investigate the impacts of wind farms on a stable ABL and a convective ABL.},

abstract = {Yaw aerodynamics were computed with three codes of different complexity; 1) The 3D Navier Stokes solver Ellipsys3D using 5-8 million grid points; 2) HAWC3D which is a 3D actuator disc model coupled to a blade element model and using 20-30.000 grid points and 3) HAWC, a finite element based aeroelastic code using the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) model for the aerodynamics. Simulations were performed for two experiments. The first is the field rotor measurements on a 100 kW turbine at Risoe where local flow angle (LFA) and local relative velocity (LRV) at one radial station have been measured in a yaw angle interval of {\&}plusmn;60{\&}deg;. The other experiment is the NREL measurements on a 10 m rotor in the NASA Ames 80 ft x 120 ft wind tunnel. LFA were measured at five radial stations and data for the 45{\&}deg; yaw case were analyzed. The measured changes in LFA caused by the yawing were used as the main parameter in the comparison with the models. In general a good correlation was found comparing the Ellipsys3D results with the LFA measured on the NREL rotor whereas a systematic underestimation of the amplitude in LFA as function of azimuth was observed for the two other models. This could possibly be ascribed to upwash influence on the measured LFA.

The amount of power extracted from the wind turbine and the power available in the wake were studied for different tilt angles of the blades varied from 0 to 15 degrees. However the wind turbine extracted less power by tilting the rotor blades, the power available in the wake downstream the turbine was significantly increased compared with zero tilt angle. The results show that control of the tilt angle can maximize the total power output of the wind farm.

abstract = {The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) height (z i) over complex, forested terrain is estimated based on the power spectra and the integral length scale of cross-stream winds obtained from a three-axis sonic anemometer during the two summers of the BEARPEX (Biosphere Effects on Aerosol and Photochemistry) Experiment. The z i values estimated with this technique show very good agreement with observations obtained from balloon tether sondes (2007) and rawinsondes (2009) under unstable conditions (z i 0) at the coniferous forest in the California Sierra Nevada. On the other hand, the low frequency behavior of the streamwise upslope winds did not exhibit significant variations and was therefore not useful in predicting boundary layer height. The behavior of the nocturnal boundary layer height (h i) with respect to the power spectra of the v i-wind component and temperature under stable conditions (z i 0) is also presented. The nocturnal boundary layer height is found to be fairly well predicted by a recent interpolation formula proposed by Zilitinkevich et al. (2007), although it was observed to only vary from 60-80 m during the 2009 experiment in which it was measured. Finally, significant directional wind shear was observed during both day and night soundings. The winds were found to be consistently backing from the prevailing west-southwesterlies within the ABL (the anabatic cross-valley circulation) to southerlies in a layer ∼1-2 km thick just above the ABL before veering to the prevailing westerlies further aloft. This shear pattern is shown to be consistent with the forcing of a thermal wind driven by the regional temperature gradient directed east-southeast in the lower troposphere. {\textcopyright} 2011 Author(s).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This work is dedicated to systematically studying and predicting the wake characteristics of a yawed wind turbine immersed in a turbulent boundary layer. To achieve this goal, wind tunnel experiments were performed to characterize the wake of a horizontal-axis wind turbine model. A high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system was used to measure the three velocity components in the turbine wake under different yaw angles and tip-speed ratios. Moreover, power and thrust measurements were carried out to analyse the performance of the wind turbine. These detailed wind tunnel measurements were then used to perform a budget study of the continuity and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for the wake of a yawed turbine. This theoretical analysis revealed some notable features of the wakes of yawed turbines, such as the asymmetric distribution of the wake skew angle with respect to the wake centre. Under highly yawed conditions, the formation of a counter-rotating vortex pair in the wake cross-section as well as the vertical displacement of the wake centre were shown and analysed. Finally, this study enabled us to develop general governing equations upon which a simple and computationally inexpensive analytical model was built. The proposed model aims at predicting the wake deflection and the far-wake velocity distribution for yawed turbines. Comparisons of model predictions with the wind tunnel measurements show that this simple model can acceptably predict the velocity distribution in the far wake of a yawed turbine. Apart from the ability of the model to predict wake flows in yawed conditions, it can provide valuable physical insight on the behaviour of turbine wakes in this complex situation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Turbulence characteristics of the wind farm inflow have a significant impact on the energy production and the lifetime of a wind farm. The common approach is to use the meteorological mast measurements to estimate the turbulence intensity (TI) but they are not always available and the turbulence varies over the extent of the wind farm. This paper describes a method to estimate the TI at individual turbine locations by using the rotor effective wind speed calculated via high frequency turbine data. The method is applied to Lillgrund and Horns Rev-I offshore wind farms and the results are compared with TI derived from the meteorological mast, nacelle mounted anemometer on the turbines and estimation based on the standard deviation of power. The results show that the proposed TI estimation method is in the best agreement with the meteorological mast. Therefore, the rotor effective wind speed is shown to be applicable for the TI assessment in real-time wind farm calculations under different operational conditions. Furthermore, the TI in the wake is seen to follow the same trend with the estimated wake deficit which enables to quantify the turbulence in terms of the wake loss locally inside the wind farm.},

@article{Fleming2015,
abstract = {Wind turbines arranged in a wind plant impact each other through their wakes. Wind plant control is an active research field that attempts to improve wind plant performance by coordinating control of individual turbines to take into account these turbine–wake interactions. In this paper, high-fidelity simulations of a two-turbine fully waked scenario are used to investigate several wake mitigation strategies, including modification of yaw and tilt angles of an upstream turbine to induce wake skew, as well as repositioning of the downstream turbine. The simulation results are compared through change relative to a baseline operation in terms of overall power capture and loading on the upstream and downstream turbine. Results demonstrated improved power production for allmethods.Analysis of control options, including individual pitch control, shows potential to minimize the increase of, or even reduce, turbine loads.},

@article{Johnson2004,
abstract = {The primary focus of this work is a new adaptive controller that is designed to resemble the standard non-adaptive controller used by the wind industry for variable speed wind turbines below rated power. This adaptive controller uses a simple, highly intuitive gain adaptation law designed to seek out the optimal gain for maximizing the turbine's energy capture. It is designed to work even in real, time-varying winds. The adaptive controller has been tested both in simulation and on a real turbine, with numerous experimental results provided in this work. Simulations have considered the effects of erroneous wind measurements and time-varying turbine parameters, both of which are concerns on the real turbine. The adaptive controller has been found to operate as desired under realistic operating conditions, and energy capture has increased on the real turbine as a result. Theoretical analyses of the standard and adaptive controllers were performed, as well, providing additional insight into the system. Finally, a few extensions were made with the intent of making the adaptive control idea even more appealing in the commercial wind turbine market.},

@article{Machefaux2015,
abstract = {The present paper deals with validation of 4 different engineering wake superposition approaches against detailed CFD simulations and covering different turbine interspacing, ambient turbulence intensities and mean wind speeds. The first engineering model is a simple linear superposition of wake deficits as applied in e.g. Fuga. The second approach is the square root of sums of squares approach, which is applied in the widely used PARK program. The third approach, which is presently used with the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) model, assumes that the wake affected downstream flow field to be determined by a superposition of the ambient flow field and the dominating wake among contributions from all upstream turbines at any spatial position and at any time. The last approach developed by G.C. Larsen is a newly developed model based on a parabolic type of approach, which combines wake deficits successively. The study indicates that wake interaction depends strongly on the relative wake deficit magnitude, i.e. the deficit magnitude normalized with respect to the ambient mean wind speed, and that the dominant wake assumption within the DWM framework is the most accurate.},

@article{Jonkman2009,
abstract = {To support concept studies aimed at assessing offshore wind technology, we developed the specifications of a representative utility-scale multimegawatt turbine now known as the “NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine.” This wind turbine is a conventional three-bladed upwind variable-speed variable blade-pitch-to-feather-controlled turbine. To create the model, we obtained some broad design information from the published documents of turbine manufacturers, with a heavy emphasis on the REpower 5M machine. Because detailed data was unavailable, however, we also used the publicly available properties from the conceptual models in the WindPACT, RECOFF, and DOWEC projects. We then created a composite from these data, extracting the best available and most representative specifications. This report documents the specifications of the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine—including the aerodynamic, structural, and control-system properties—and the rationale behind its development. The model has been, and will likely continue to be, used as a reference by research teams throughout the world to standardize baseline offshore wind turbine specifications and to quantify the benefits of advanced land- and sea-based wind energy technologies.},

@article{Bastankhah2017,
abstract = {Miniature wind turbines, employed in wind tunnel experiments to study the interaction of turbines with turbulent boundary layers, usually suffer from poor performance with respect to their large-scale counterparts in the field. Moreover, although wakes of wind turbines have been extensively examined in wind tunnel studies, the proper characterization of the performance of wind turbines has received relatively less attention. In this regard, the present study concerns the design and the performance analysis of a new three-bladed horizontal-axis miniature wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 15 cm. Due to its small size, this turbine, called WiRE-01, is particularly suitable for studies of wind farm flows and the interaction of the turbine with an incoming boundary-layer flow. Especial emphasis was placed on the accurate measurement of the mechanical power extracted by the miniature turbine from the incoming wind. In order to do so, a new setup was developed to directly measure the torque of the rotor shaft. Moreover, to provide a better understanding on the connection between the mechanical and electrical aspects of miniature wind turbines, the performance of three different direct-current (DC) generators was studied. It is found that electrical outputs of the tested generators can be used to provide a rather acceptable estimation of the mechanical input power. Force and power measurements showed that the thrust and power coefficients of the miniature turbine can reach 0.8 and 0.4, respectively, which are close to the ones of large-scale turbines in the field. In Part II of this study, the wake structure and dynamic flow characteristics are studied for the new miniature turbine immersed in a turbulent boundary-layer flow.},
